This project is about the characterization of
a single protein domain. As starting point,
each group is provided with a representative
domain sequence and the corresponding Pfam
identifier. The objective of the first part of
the project is to build a sequence model starting
from the assigned sequence. In the second
part, the actual domain family characterization is
performed analyzing different aspects: structure,
taxonomy and functions. Along with a PDF
report, each group is asked to submit domain
models, code, commands and generated data as
supplementary material.
